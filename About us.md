🌟 Inspiration Behind Krishna.AI
The seed for Krishna.AI was planted in our own homes. We saw our parents—curious, spiritually inclined, and hungry for the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita—struggle to find time in their busy lives to study and reflect on its teachings. It made us wonder: How many others feel the same way?

That question became our calling.

We realized that while the Gita's wisdom is timeless, the way it's delivered needs to evolve with the times. With Krishna.AI, we aim to bridge that gap—offering the depth of ancient spiritual insights through the ease and accessibility of modern technology.

🕉 "Our families were our first teachers—and this project is our way of giving back, not just to them, but to anyone seeking guidance, clarity, or a quiet moment of truth."
